# USB Ethernet on a Wii U — what is actually known

A running log. Everything here is either measured on the console, read
out of a file, or cited. Anything I have not checked says so.

> **Status: research, nothing built.** The goal is a working USB Ethernet
> adapter in **Wii U mode** (vWii would be a bonus). The reason is
> measured: the console's built-in Wi-Fi gives **9.3 Mbit/s** with a ping
> wandering between 9 and 94 ms, and the Wii U video chain is configured
> at 8 Mbit/s. The link is the constraint, not the encoder.

## The correction that changes the plan

The idea was to pick up someone's abandoned work. **That work does not
apply to Wii U mode.**

The existing AX88772B/C patcher patches **IOS80, IOS58 and IOS36** —
those are **vWii** IOSes, the Wii-compatibility side. It gives Ethernet
in *Wii mode*. Wii U titles, and a Wii U homebrew like ours, do not go
anywhere near them.

So for Wii U mode there is **no prior art to continue**. There is prior
art to *learn the shape of the problem from*, which is not the same
thing, and the difference is most of the work.

## The adapter in hand

| chipset | on this desk | Wii U |
|---|---|---|
| ASIX **AX88772** | no | ✅ what the official adapter (WUP-025) uses |
| ASIX **AX88179** | ✅ `0b95:1790` | ❌ not supported |
| Realtek **RTL8153** | ✅ `0bda:8153` | ❌ not supported |

Someone did try AX88179 by copying the init sequence out of the Linux
driver. The adapter's LED would not even light, and the attempt was
abandoned. That is the honest baseline: the last person to try this got
nothing at all out of the hardware.

## Where the Wii U's driver lives

Read off the console over FTP with `systemFilesAllowed`, read-only:

```
/storage_slc/sys/title/00050010/1000400a/code/fw.img   <- IOSU firmware, the ARM side
/storage_slc/sys/title/00050010/10004009/code/fw.img
/storage_slc/sys/title/00050010/100040ff/code/fw.img
```

The same directories hold the PPC-side libraries — `nsysnet.rpl`,
`nn_nets2.rpl`. Those are the *socket API* that a program calls; they are
not the driver. The USB Ethernet driver is an IOSU module, ARM, inside
`fw.img`.

vWii's own IOSes, for reference, are at
`/slccmpt01/title/00000001/{00000050,0000003a,00000024}` — IOS80, IOS58,
IOS36. Present on this console.

## What is set up here

- `reference/` — the Linux drivers for both chipsets, from kernel.org:
  `asix.h`, `asix_common.c`, `asix_devices.c` (AX88772 family) and
  `ax88179_178a.c` (AX88179). **GPL-2.0, reference only.** They are
  gitignored and must not be copied into this project — the same rule
  that kept Moonlight's `font.c` out of `wiiu_console/`.
- `ios/` — the pulled firmware, gitignored: it is Nintendo's, and it is
  console-specific.
- Ghidra 12.1.2 is at `~/logiciels/ghidra_12.1.2_PUBLIC`
  (`support/analyzeHeadless` for scripted runs).

## Reading the two Linux drivers is the first real task

Not to copy them — to measure the distance. `asix_devices.c` and
`ax88179_178a.c` are different drivers for a reason, and the size of
that reason is the size of this project. What matters:

- the register map, and whether it is the same space at all
- how the PHY is brought up
- the RX header format — the 772 patcher had to fix RX header alignment
  for the B/C, and getting that wrong "silently corrupts every inbound
  packet", which is exactly the failure that looks like nothing at all
- the URB/endpoint layout, since the 179 is a USB 3.0 part

## The firmware is open — done

`fw.img`, 14,668,288 bytes, pulled read-only off the console. An **ancast
image**: magic `EFA282D9`, device type **2 (Starbuck, the ARM side)`,
body `0xDFD000` bytes at offset `0x200`, which accounts for the file
exactly.

**The key is at OTP offset 0x090.** Not looked up — found, and the method
matters because the obvious one does not work. The image carries a SHA-1
at `0x1B0`, and it is tempting to brute-force the OTP against it. That
fails: checked, and that hash is of the body **as stored, encrypted**.
It cannot confirm a decryption.

What does confirm one is entropy. Every 16-byte window of the OTP was
tried as an AES-128-CBC key and the result measured:

    ciphertext                     7.9971 bits/byte
    otp 0x090                      6.0438      <- structure
    every other candidate          7.9963 .. 7.9979

One candidate, no ambiguity, and the plaintext it produces is firmware
padding. The IV does not matter: CBC resynchronises after one block, so
an unknown IV costs the first sixteen bytes and nothing else.

`tools/ancast.py` does this. The key value appears nowhere in this
repository, and neither the OTP nor any decrypted image is committed.

## Where the driver is

Confirmed inside the decrypted image, which names itself:

    usb_eth_asix.c                  the driver's own source filename
    __ax8817xReadCommand            register access
    __ax8817xWriteCommand
    USB Ethernet Network Interface
    BMCR = 0x%04x                   PHY registers, in its debug strings
    ANLPAR = 0x%04x
    BMSR = 0x%04x

and its whole function table beside them: `__handleUhsDevProbe`,
`__uhsIfProbeCallback`, `__UsbEthCtrlrConfigure`, `__UsbEthCtrlSendFrame`,
`__UsbEthCtrlReceiveFrame`, `__UsbEthCtrlHandleUrbCompletion`,
`__postLinkStatusUrb`, `__openControllerDriver`, `__removeDriver`.

The image is an ARM ELF at file offset `0x604`, 72 program headers --
each IOSU module is a segment with its own load address.

| what | segment | vaddr | file offset | size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| the module's **code** | 29 | `0x12300000` | `0x2E2694` | `0x131844` |
| its strings/rodata | 30 | `0x12440000` | `0x413ED8` | `0x288E8` |
| `/dev/uhs` (USB host stack) | 18 | `0x10140000` | `0x0F51D0` | `0x4694` |

**For Ghidra**: load `ios/fw.dec` as raw ARM (big-endian off, 32-bit),
map file `0x2E2694` at `0x12300000` for the code and `0x413ED8` at
`0x12440000` for the data, then let it find the string references. The
function names above are in the data segment, so the labels come free.

## The thing worth thinking about before writing any ARM

`/dev/uhs` is the USB host stack, and **it is reachable from PPC
userspace** -- wut exposes it (`UhsClientOpen`, bulk and control
transfers). A homebrew can already drive an arbitrary USB device without
touching IOSU at all.

That opens a second route that nobody seems to have tried, and it avoids
patching a system component entirely: implement the AX88179 in the
homebrew, in userspace, over `/dev/uhs`. The cost is that the console's
own network stack would not know about it -- packets would have to be
carried by something of ours. For this project specifically that may be
acceptable, since what we want is one TCP stream from one host.

It is worth measuring before choosing: **does `/dev/uhs` even enumerate
the AX88179?** If the answer is no, both routes are dead and the adapter
is simply the wrong one. That is one small homebrew and an afternoon,
and it is the cheapest question in this whole document.

## The cheapest question, answered: YES

`uhsprobe/` asks `/dev/uhs` for every interface it has, with
`MATCH_ANY`. On this console, with the adapter plugged in:

    UhsClientOpen -> 0
    UhsQueryInterfaces -> 2 interface(s)
      [0] 0b95:1790  dev class ff vendor specific  if ff/ff/00  handle 131074
            in  ep 81  attr 03 (interrupt)  max 8      <- link status
            in  ep 82  attr 02 (bulk)       max 512    <- RX
            out ep 03  attr 02 (bulk)       max 512    <- TX
      [1] 1058:25a2  mass storage 08/06/50             <- the WD drive

**The host stack enumerates the AX88179 perfectly.** It is only the
*driver* that will not bind to it. And the endpoint layout is exactly
what the Linux driver expects of this part: interrupt IN for link
status, bulk IN, bulk OUT.

`max 512` says it negotiated USB 2.0 high speed. The 179 is a USB 3.0
part and this console has no USB 3.0 ports, so it is running in its
high-speed mode -- which is what the Linux driver handles anyway, and
which caps the link at well above the 9.3 Mbit/s we are trying to beat.

So a userspace driver over `/dev/uhs` is not hypothetical. The device is
there, addressable, with a handle.

What is still unproven is whether `UhsAcquireInterface` will hand it
over. Nothing else has claimed it -- no driver binds a vendor-specific
class it does not know -- so it should be free, but should is not
measured.

## Next, in order

1. Acquire the interface and do one control transfer: read the MAC
   address out of the adapter. That is the smallest possible proof that
   we can talk to the hardware, and the Linux driver says exactly which
   register to ask for.
2. Read both Linux drivers and write the differences down here --
   register map, PHY bring-up, RX header format, endpoint layout.
3. Ghidra on segment 29 and compare its init sequence with Linux's
   `asix_devices.c`.
4. Only then choose: patch IOSU, or a userspace driver over `/dev/uhs`.

A rewrite inside a system component, with no debugger and "the LED does
not light" as the only feedback, is where the last attempt stopped. Step
1 exists so that we find out cheaply whether we would be walking into
the same wall.

## An honest alternative, kept in view

An AX88772-based adapter costs a few euros and works immediately. This
project is worth doing if it is interesting; it is not the cheap way to
get the console onto a wire.
