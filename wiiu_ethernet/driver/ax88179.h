/*
 * An ASIX AX88179 driver for the Wii U, in PPC userspace over /dev/uhs.
 *
 * The console's own IOSU driver only binds the AX88772 -- checked, its
 * module even names its source file `usb_eth_asix.c` -- so an AX88179
 * is enumerated by the USB host stack and then ignored. Measured on the
 * console: the host stack sees it (0b95:1790, interrupt IN + bulk IN +
 * bulk OUT), hands the interface over on request, and answers a control
 * transfer with its real MAC address. Everything below is built on those
 * three facts and not on hope.
 *
 * The register numbers and the order of the bring-up come from reading
 * Linux's `ax88179_178a.c`, which is GPL-2.0. Numbers a chip responds to
 * are facts about the chip; this code is written from them rather than
 * copied, and that distinction is the reason this file can live in this
 * project at all.
