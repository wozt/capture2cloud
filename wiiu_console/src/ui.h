/*
 * Drawing and input, on SDL2.
 *
 * Not OSScreen, and that is the one architectural fact this client is
 * built around: measured on the console, once OSScreen has been up, GX2
 * renders nothing at all -- WHBGfxInit still succeeds, frames still
 * count, and the screen stays black. Everything that matters here is
 * GX2: the console's own keyboard, the HOME overlay, and eventually an
 * NV12 video texture. So the program is GX2 from its first line, and
 * SDL2's Wii U renderer -- which reports itself as "WiiU GX2",
 * accelerated -- is how it gets there without a shader assembler, which
 * this toolchain does not have.
 *
 * One window, mirrored to the television and the GamePad. Touch arrives
 * in this window's coordinates, so there is nothing left to guess about
 * which resolution the panel speaks -- a question that cost two rounds
 * against the raw VPAD API.
