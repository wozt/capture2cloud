/*
 * An on-screen pad, for playing with the console flat on a table and
 * nothing plugged into it.
 *
 * The same idea as the browser page's touch overlay, and laid out the
 * same way: sticks and clusters positioned in units of one size so the
 * whole thing scales together, the d-pad a single round zone rather than
 * four buttons so diagonals work, and every control its own touch target
 * so several fingers do several things at once.
 *
 * It does not replace the physical pad -- both are read and combined, so
 * a Joy-Con in one hand and a thumb on the glass is a valid way to play.
